### About
All I can think every day is that" a lawyer is required to be a sportsman. " And, the sportsman I think, says a person who satisfies all of ④ from the following ①. That is,
① sportsmanship to take care of,
② that there is a basic physical strength,
③ that you have a strong mental power,
④ it is refreshing
is.
First of all, it is about the ①, and the sportsmanship, it is a matter of course to comply with the rules, says the character or manners in performing the sport. Lawyer, but it is that of course to comply with the rules of law, in carrying out their duties, must be to take care of the character or manners as a lawyer.
Then, it is about the ②, duties as a lawyer, you have to be a very hard schedule at the time. Even in such a situation, because of the client's everyone, any projects also can not be such as to pull out the hand. Therefore, the lawyer, you need a basic physical strength of the body.
In addition, although it is about ③, lawyer, will be involved as an agent in the dispute between the requester and the other party.
