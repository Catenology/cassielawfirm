### About
Ideal lawyer image that I think is just the law to abide not only, thing that considering its background circumstances when an individual dispute, it is possible to achieve a reasonable solution.
And, disputes arising in the individual is not the same cases as one, can not be addressed by standardized solutions.
I, standing in a position towards the person of the requester and counseling person, to be able to suggest the best solution, we would like to continue working in all sincerity.
